                        <p>Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Charlotte and I'm a first-year mechanical engineering 
                            master's student at Carnegie Mellon. I enjoy problem solving, designing, and making, especially with 
                            teams of other passionate engineers and researchers with different backgrounds and interests. I'm 
                            fascinated by machine learning algorithms and their ability to learn and predict traditional mechanical 
                            systems which is why I joined the Mechanics and AI Lab at CMU where I currently work on a project involving 
                            robotic manipulation of deformable objects. Outside of class I enjoy reading, trail running, crafting, 
                            and climbing.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">This project attempts to quantify the human-likeness of sound produced by 
                                        a humanoid robot. The robot has no speakers and produces sound from a variable pitch pneumatic
                                        sound generator and resonance tube deformed by a series of servo motors along its length. The 
                                        robot was designed and built by my groupmate, Maddy Weaver, and we used it to study human-like 
                                        sound using deep learning methods as part of Carnegie Mellon's Introduction to Machine Learning for 
                                        Engineers course.

                                        we can then use this metric to rate each sound and iteratively update the robot's hardware to 
                                        produce a more human-like sound.

                                        of amplitude and time. However, to extract useful information from these signals, a Fourier 
                                        transform can be applied to decompose a signal into its individual frequencies and their 
                                        amplitudes and therefore convert from the time to frequency domain.

                                        these signals in the frequency domain, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed over several 
                                        windowed segments of the signal. What results is called a spectrogram. Spectrograms are 
                                        visualizations or figures of audio that represent the spectrum of frequencies over time for 
                                        an audio recording.

                                    <p class="text-muted">My groupmate collected several thousand audio recordings from the robot 
                                        (Matlab script is available on my GitHub under "matlab data collection"). To construct the 
                                        dataset, we first structured each data point as a sequence of 3 varied pitches with a 
                                        repeating open and closed actuation of the mouth. We then populated each sequence with an 
                                        initial guess of the relative pitch values of a high-level, rising, dipping or a falling tone, 
                                        then labeled them as such. We executed these tones on the robot and recorded the audio output.
                                        There was an equal class distribution in these data.

                                        Chinese each recorded from six speakers using four different tones: high-level tone, rising 
                                        tone, dipping tone, and falling tone. We used 4,500 of these audio files.

                                        configurations in the hopes of obtaining a more human-like sound would be long. Therefore, 
                                        we chose to augment data from the robot in different ways to speed up iteration cycles.

                                        resulted in an increased pitch. Each audio signal was then pitched down by 1.5 octaves to 
                                        return to its original pitch. This was based on human perception of the original pitch and 
                                        was not quantitatively computed.

                                    <p class="text-muted">The goal of the model was to learn from MFCC's based on audio produced by humans, 
                                        specifically 4,500 signals from the Tone Perfect database, and be tested on 1,120

                                        predictions: high value predictions for human-like sounds and low value predictions for 
                                        non-human-like sounds. This, however, proved to be a difficult goal.

                                        accuracy was 92.4% as shown in Fig. 9. This proves the model can successfully classify robot

                                        loss, as shown in Fig. 10, which provides an indication of overfitting in the training data. 
                                        The training accuracy was above 99% which is another indication the model began to overfit 
                                        the training data and is therefore unable to generalize. This resulted in heavy overprediction

                                        an accuracy of 25.71% and was able to predict tones beyond class 3 but was still largely

                                    <p class="text-muted">As this was only a semester long project, my group wasn't able to run all the 
                                        experiments we wanted to. For future work, we would look more into updating the hardware 
                                        by either replacing the bagpipe reed with a sound generation mechanism with a larger span of 
                                        possible pitches or replacing our air pump with one with a larger span of possible speeds. This 
                                        would all be in an attempt to manually produce a sound that sounds more human-like, before 
                                        studying which features a neural network uses to classify each tone. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">A deep reinforcement learning approach could also be attempted. As the goal 
                                        of this algorithm is to maximize the accumulated reward, the agent can ignore possible 
                                        limitations in hardware as it is solely identifying the best possible combination of actions 
                                        to determine the optimal policy. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">The reward estimation could be directly correlated to the softmax predictions 
                                        of the model, wherein the predicted value of the desired tone is used as the reward for the 
                                        agent.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Final Word:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">This is certainly a unique problem and this project is far from complete.

                                    <p class="text-muted">About half a million children and adults in the United States rely on feeding 
                                        tubes everyday and there are customer needs among this population that devices on the market 
                                        have not yet addressed such as durability.
                                        
                                        The quality of devices like the one shown in Figure 1 is crucial to ensuring patient safety and 
                                        comfort. Further research and development in this field will allow for customer reviews and 
                                        complaints of current products on the market to be addressed. Innovation in the medical device 
                                        industry in general is therefore crucial in ensuring that the medical needs of all patients 
                                        are met.

                                        subsequently defined the problem to provide a basis for development. As part of the research 
                                        phase, I developed a customer requirements table along with accompanying functional requirements, 
                                        technical interpretations, technical specifications, and metrics.

                                        that address similar customer requirements was then completed. 
                                        These technologies included products for purchase as well as several U.S. patents.

                                        provides a concept design for a gastrostomy button similar to the mentioned products but with 
                                        some improvements. The design offers a non-balloon internal bolster approach to allow for longer 
                                        wear time as gastrostomy buttons with silicone balloons must be replaced approximately every 
                                        three months to prevent rupture due to the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCI) present in 
                                        gastric fluid. The design also includes two sets of silicone pleats that act as springs to 
                                        stabilize the port. An image displaying two views of the patented design are shown below in

                                    <p class="text-muted">The design process focused on addressing all customer needs especially those 
                                        involving patient safety and reliability. As part of the design process, several 3D printed 
                                        prototypes of the design were developed, tested, and iterated upon. One of the first prototypes
                                        is shown in Fig. 4. 
                                    </p>    

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/gastrostomy/5.png" alt="..." />

                                        with thin metal rod</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">Although the first prototype was partially validated through testing, a 
                                        device made of silicone rubber only addresses customer requirement 02 regarding reliability to 
                                        an extent. Gastric fluid is highly acidic and contains parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric 
                                        acid (HCI) to inactivate microorganisms (Heda et. al. 2021). Because of this, most gastrostomy 
                                        skin level devices made from medical grade silicone rubber must be removed approximately every 
                                        4 months to ensure the internal bolster does not degrade. However, to achieve long-term 
                                        durability, a material like polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) can be used as it is highly resistant 
                                        to HCI between concentrations of 0%-37% and is biocompatible.

                                    <p class="text-muted">The first change made to the second prototype was reducing the thickness and width of the 
                                        panels that make up the internal bolster to reduce overall material so the panels would nicely 
                                        collapse when stretched. A schematic of the second prototype with labels is shown in Figure 5.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Other changes made to the design before building the second prototype addressed 
                                        customer requirements 01, safety, and 05, ability for the device to be low-profile.  The external 
                                        bolster was reduced to a diameter of 12.5 mm from 52.5 mm previously to reduce the overall 
                                        volume making the device more low-profile. The tether was increased in width to 2 mm as opposed 
                                        to 1 mm previously to reduce the risk of fracture.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">The cap was updated to feature custom threads to ensure they cannot interface with other 
                                        small-bore connectors that may be in a health care setting. This is a preventative step to 
                                        ensure patient safety and is outlined in ISO 80369-3: Small-bore connectors for liquids and

                                    <h5>Background:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">This project was part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Engineering 
                                        Innovation for Society (EIS) Blitz which is a condensed 4-week challenge offered as part of 
                                        the Inventors’ Studio 2 capstone course. The purpose of the challenge is to quickly work 
                                        through the Lean Design for Six Sigma process. The theme for this semester encouraged students 
                                        to look at the impact humans are making on marine ecosystems.

                                        My team and I decided to focus our design on kelp forests. Kelp forests are currently diminishing 
                                        off the western coast of the United States and Mexico due to warming waters and overfishing of 
                                        white abalone. The white abalone diet consists of algae that grows on rock surfaces on the ocean 
                                        floor. Abalone therefore help to clear rocky surfaces providing an optimal place for kelp to grow.

                                    <h5>Objective:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">To address the overgrowth of algae due to the decreasing population of 
                                        white abalone, my team and I decided to create an algae filtration system to mimic the 
                                        abilities of a white abalone. The system would work in conjunction with current efforts to 
                                        reduce overfishing of white abalone, seed white abalone in restored kelp forests, and require 
                                        preventative action against climate change.</p>

                                    <h5>Approach:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The idea behind the algae filtration system is that it will be secured to 
                                        the rock surfaces in endangered kelp forests via a strong suction cup. It will then be able 
                                        to clean the rock surfaces of algae using a motor-powered brush located on the bottom of the 
                                        system. After the brush releases the algae from the rock surface, a motor-powered turbine will 
                                        produce a vacuum that will pull the now algae-filled water through the filter. Algae will 
                                        become trapped on the underside of the filter while clean water will exit through a top vent 
                                        in the external casing. I created all of the following CAD models and assemblies using 
                                        Solidworks.</p> 

                                    <h5>Components:</h5>
                                    <h6>External Casing</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The external casing is an 11 inch by 7 inch by 4.25 inch enclosure made of 
                                        Nylon 6/6 as this material has high corrosion resistance and behaves well in marine environments 
                                        for extended periods of time. This material is also easily injection moldable meaning it would 
                                        be relatively cheap to manufacture several hundred of these enclosures.

                                    The round brush and heavy-duty suction cup can be seen in Fig. 2 as well as the openings in the 
                                    bottom of the external casing that lead to the filter. </p>

                                    <h6>Internal Components</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The external casing houses two 12 volt (V) DC motors, a turbine (Fig. 3.5), 
                                        two simple filters made of mesh, and a 12V 8 ampere-hour (A hr.) SLA battery, shown as the 
                                        large black box in Fig. 3. The turbine is press-fit onto the output shaft of one of the DC 
                                        motors while the other DC motor is connected to the round brush.</p>

                                    <h5>Prototype:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The system prototype is a 3D printed 1:2 scaled version of the full system 
                                        and includes two DC motors, one suction cup, a 2 inch diameter round brush, and a turbine. The 
                                        battery does not fit inside the scaled enclosure so the DC motors were attached to a 12V power 
                                        adapter for the final prototype testing presentation. The DC motors are waterproofed with 
                                        Sugru™ and marine grease. Images of the prototype are shown below in Figs. 4-6.</p>

                                    <h5>Challenges:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">I thought it would be most meaningful to our presentation to test the 
                                        prototype underwater but this meant the DC motors had to be waterproofed. I originally 
                                        thought sticking them in a food storage container would be adequate but containers I found 
                                        that fit the motors were very large and would require me to scale the enclosure to fit over 
                                        them. I then read this article from robotshop.com about waterproofing motors for marine use 
                                        using Sugru™ and marine grease.</p> 

                                    <p class="text-muted">I rolled out small cylinders of Sugru™ and pressed them into all gaps in 
                                        the external casing and then added marine grease to the output shaft, as 
                                        shown in Fig. 5, to ensure water does not enter between the casing and the shaft.</p>

                                    <h5>Prototype Testing:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The prototype was tested in a clear container filled with tap water. The 
                                        wires from each motor were clamped to the side of the container to ensure they do not come 
                                        in contact with the water. Each motor was connected to a 12V power adapter to test whether the 
                                        motors were fully functional after waterproofing.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">A poster was designed to present along with the prototype testing presentation.

                                        300 of the product will be produced from raw materials in the RPI Manufacturing Innovation 
                                        Learning Lab (MILL). The TDP includes all information for the product including product 
                                        component descriptions, a bill of materials, all technical drawings for product components and

                                    <h5>Approach:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The team was split into roles, and from there, our team’s globe model was 
                                        developed and used to outline every step of the manufacturing and assembly process for our 
                                        product.</p>

                                    <h5>Components:</h5>
                                    <h6>Baseplate</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The base plate adds weight to the bottom of the assembly such that the user can spin 
                                        the globe without it tipping over. I designed the baseplate with a 3 inch diameter and 0.25 inch height. 
                                        It also features a clearance hole for the 6-32 threaded rod and a 0.05 inch chamfer.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/globe/3.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fig. 2: Base plate of product designed for CNC machining from Aluminum 6061</p> 

                                    <h6>Base Body</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The base body is the housing for the 9V battery and power switch. I designed it with 
                                        constant wall thickness of 0.07 inches and a 3 degree draft on all vertical surfaces to abide by 
                                        plastic injection molding design parameters.</p> 

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/globe/4.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fig. 3: Base body designed for plastic injection molding from 
                                        ABS plastic</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">The base body also has 4 bosses extruded from its underside such that the 
                                        base connector disk can be screwed into the bottom of the base body.</p> 

                                    <p class="text-muted">The “Rensselaer” text is CNC machined into the part post-plastic injection 
                                        molding to avoid use of a side-action cam in the PIM mold.</p> 

                                    <h6>Base Connector</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The base connector interfaces with the bottom surface of the base body and 
                                        is secured by four 4-40 flat head screws. The connector also has a thickness of 0.07 inches 
                                        such that the mold for it can be implemented into the same mold as the base body. A center 
                                        boss with a tapped hole secures the base connector to the threaded rod which extends the 
                                        entire height of the assembly.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/globe/5.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fig. 4: Base connector designed for plastic injection molding</p>

                                    <h6>Globe Connector Disk</h6>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The globe connector disk is the interface between both vacuum-formed 
                                        globe halves upon which they are heat staked. The two outermost pins exist for the purpose 
                                        of heat staking. Similar to the base body and base connector, the globe connector has a 
                                        thickness of 0.07 inches such that it can be produced using the same mold as the other two 
                                        parts.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/globe/6.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fig. 5: Globe connector designed for plastic injection molding</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">An off-centered boss with a 2-56 tapped hole was added to secure the 
                                        circular PCBa as shown in Fig. 6. Small pins were also added to act as support pins 
                                        for the PCBa and lift it off the main surface of the globe connector.</p>

                                    <h5>Approach:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">To address the first objective, I designed a subassembly for the probe. Two 
                                        small translational stages (Thorlabs DT12) are used: one is mounted to the elevated stage and 
                                        allows movement of the arm in the x, and one is mounted to the arm and allows movement of 
                                        clamped substrate in the z.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fig. 4: Probe Subassembly</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">The substrate clamp restricts all movement of the substrate and ensures the 
                                        electrodes are in the same location for every test. The bottom part of the clamp is permanantly 
                                        secured to the translational stage while the top part can easily be removed via two captive 
                                        screws.  
                                    </p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/electrode/3.png" alt="..." />

                                    <p class="text-muted">The electrode needed to intercept with the probes at a certain angle and 
                                        was therefore mounted onto a 3D printed part and clamped into place in a similar way to the 
                                        substrate: via a captive screw. I press fit an insert into the bottom part of the electrode 
                                        clamp to ensure the threads wouldn't strip after many uses. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">The electrode clamp extends from the front camera via a strut channel as 
                                        shown in Fig. 7. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">To mount the cameras, I first designed a 90 degree bracket to secure the 
                                        3-axis translational stages (Thorlabs DT12XYZ) to the aluminum breadboard. Then, I designed 
                                        another bracket to mount the round, lens mounting clamp (Infinity Large Mounting Clamp) to 
                                        the stages. This would allow each camera three degrees of freedom and a secure and minimally
                                        invasive way to mount the cameras. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">All four of the brackets were first cut from a 1 ft. Aluminum 6061 L bar
                                        and manually machined to obtain the cutout for the stages and necessary holes and 
                                        countersinks as shown in Fig. 8.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">I 3D printed all components of the probe subassembly, press-fit inserts 
                                        into the substrate clamp (Fig. 11) and assembled them onto the laser-cut acrylic stage 
                                        elevated by hex standoffs. The clear container for PBS is a simple storage container from

                                    <p class="text-muted">At one of my internships I sat at a desk right next to an aisleway. I had 
                                        this idea that I wanted some kind of separator that also doubled as an organizer for some of 
                                        the tools I used everyday. None of the desk organizers I could find on Amazon were quite what 
                                        I wanted so when I got home I quickly modeled an idea in Solidworks.</p>

                                    <h5>Objectives:</h5>
                                    <p class="text-muted">I wanted the design to have an elevated surface for my plant to sit on. 
                                        This, along with compartments to organize my desk items, would create a sort of separator 
                                        between me and the aisleway next to my desk. I also wanted the freedom to adjust the size of 
                                        the organizer in case I ended up needing more space on the desktop.</p>
